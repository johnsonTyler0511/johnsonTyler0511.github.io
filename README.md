# Tyler Starter Portfolio
Repo for my portfolio github pages site. 

### About 
This portfolio page covers most of the public projects I have worked on in my early career.
I am currently working on a Robot motion planning and control project as well as exploring Isaac Sim and Omniverse. 
I also am working on integrating more of my class/private projects learnings into a publicly releasable project. 
Stay tuned!! ;)
